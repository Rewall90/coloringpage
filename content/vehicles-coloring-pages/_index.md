  This section includes coloring pages featuring all kinds of vehicles, cars,
  trains, planes, boats, and more. Each set focuses on a different type of
  transportation and is designed for use at home, in classrooms, or as part of
  travel-themed activities. The pages can be downloaded as vector-based PDFs, so
  they print cleanly at any size. These coloring sheets help kids recognize
  everyday vehicles and practice fine motor skills in a fun, hands-on way.
  Whether itâ€™s something that drives, flies, or floats, these printables make it
  easy to explore the world of movement through color.
