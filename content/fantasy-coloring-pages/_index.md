  Here you'll find a bunch of fantasy-themed coloring pages — dragons, unicorns,
  castles, and a variety of other fun creatures. It’s a mix of different
  designs, so there’s likely something here your kids will enjoy, especially if
  they like drawing or making up stories.


  You can download them all for free. They come as PDFs and work with regular
  printers — both US Letter and A4 sizes. A lot of people use them at home or
  for school activities, and they’re also great for parties or quick art
  sessions on a rainy day.
